//Silver Medal (10 points):
//Write an if/else-if/else statement that prints "strict" if 1 strictly equals "1" , 
//prints "loose" or "abstract" if 1 equals "1" without type checking, and prints "not equal at all" if it doesn't print the other stuff.
//Write an if statement that prints "yes" if 1 is less than or equal to 2 AND (&&) 2 is equal to 4.

var i = 1;

if (i === 1){
    console.log("strict")
}
else if (i = "1"){
    console.log("loose");
}
else {
    console.log("not equal at all");
}
//if (i <= 2 && (2 = 4)){
    //console.log("yes");

//}
