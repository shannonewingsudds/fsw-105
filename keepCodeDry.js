//1. Write a function that accepts two numbers as parameters and returns the sum.

//Call the function

//2. Write a function that accepts three numbers as parameters and returns the largest of those numbers.  
  //Hint: you will need to Math.max() to find the largest of all numbers provided as input.
console.log("----Requirement #2----");
//3. Write a function that accepts one number as a parameter and returns whether that number is even or odd. 
  //(Return the string "even" or "odd")
console.log("----Requirement #3----");
//4. Write a function that accepts a string as a parameter. If the length of the string is less than or equal 
  //to twenty characters long, return the string concatenated with itself (string + string). If the string is more 
  //than twenty characters long, return the first half of the string.  Hint: for the else part, you will need to use .slice()  
  //(Links to an external site.)  property in conjunction with .length() property.
